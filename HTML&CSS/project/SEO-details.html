        I optimize websites for better visibility on Google.
        From meta tags and keywords to mobile responsiveness
        and fast loading speed — I take care of everything
        to improve your search ranking and organic traffic.
        <br>
        At ABC Company, I actively integrate Search Engine Optimization
        (SEO) best practices into every stage of website development
        to ensure high visibility and better rankings in search engines.
        My on-page SEO work includes writing clean and semantic HTML,
        using proper heading structures, adding alt attributes to images, 
        and optimizing meta tags such as titles and descriptions. I also focus
        on creating keyword-optimized, user-friendly URLs and apply schema markup
        (structured data) to enhance how pages appear in search results.
        From a technical SEO perspective, I ensure that websites are fast, mobile-friendly,
        and easy to crawl. This includes implementing lazy loading, compressing images,
        minifying assets, optimizing Core Web Vitals, and setting up XML sitemaps and robots.
        txt files. I pay close attention to internal linking, canonical tags,
        and other structural elements that affect how search engines understand and rank content.
        In addition, I use tools like Google Search Console, Google Analytics,
        and Lighthouse for SEO audits and performance tracking.
        I’m also familiar with SEO plugins like Yoast SEO for WordPress projects and have experience
        supporting off-page SEO efforts such as backlinking in collaboration with marketing teams.
        My goal is to develop websites that are not only visually appealing but also optimized 
        to drive organic traffic and improve user experience.
